# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Lab-5 - Image Maps

**Discussion:** In Chapter 5, you will practice making certains areas of images interactive and link them to other web pages.

1. Complete the chapter tutorial on pages 233-271.
1. Complete Lab 3 on page 279.
1. Complete **Cases and Places** number 3 in the text on page 281. In this one, you're extending the functionality of the lab. Just add three new links either to the main image map or to the pages linked by it.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
